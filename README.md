Introduction:

Security logs are often stored in text files. To analyze the security logs in these files, security analysts have toimport and parse these files. Python has some functions that come in handy for these tasks, allowing analysts toefficiently access information from text files.

In this lab, you'll practice using functions and other syntax in Python to import and parse text files.


Scenario
In this lab, you're working as a security analyst. You're responsible for preparing a security log file for analysisand creating a text file with IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information.
